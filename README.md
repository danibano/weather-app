# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard, that shows a city's current weather and the future conditions over the next five days. Using the weather API we get the information on the date, city, an icon representation of the weather, the humidity, temperature, and wind speed. When you search for a city, that city is saved using local storage and you are presented with a search history. I learned how to get information from an api and save it local storage.
